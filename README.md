# Running sDev and divbloxPHP locally

## Idea

The idea with this is to provide developers with a way to develop sDev and divbloxPHP web applications locally using containers. This is build on the [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/johanmarx/stratusolve_php_apache) and you can find a bit more info.

## Requirements

### A Unix-like OS

This guide was written and tested for Unix-based operating systems. So macOS, BSD or any Linux distribution should work. There are some notes for Windows but as a whole, this guide will not specifically cater to or diverge for Windows users.

[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) can be an option, but it comes with its own set of challenges.

### Git

Git should be already installed on most systems. If not, you can find it [here](https://git-scm.com/)

Run the following command in the terminal to ensure you have it installed:

```bash
git -v
```

### GitHub CLI

Go [here](https://cli.github.com/) or check your package manager to install the GitHub CLI tool.

Run the following command in the terminal to ensure you have it installed:

```bash
gh help
```

### Docker + Docker-Compose

Go [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to get Docker Desktop. Follow the instructions for your operating system.

Alternatively, you can install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) manually.

Run the following commands in the terminal to ensure you have it installed:

```bash
docker -v
docker-compose -v
docker ps
```

### Manual DNS entries

This will allow you and other services to connect to your containers using friendly DNS names on your local machine.

Edit your machine's hosts file and add the following lines as an example:

```
127.0.0.1   appname.dxgroup.local
127.0.0.1   redisinsight.dxgroup.local
```

#### Hosts File Locations

-   Linux: `/etc/hosts`
-   macOS: `/private/etc/hosts`
-   Windows: `c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.file`

#### Validate

Run the following command to check if the DNS entries are used:

```bash
ping appname.dxgroup.local
```

You should see responses from our localhost with IP `127.0.0.1`. Otherwise, check your setup or try restarting your machine.

## Steps

### GitHub CLI Login

In your terminal type the following command:

```bash
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts and log in with your GitHub account.

### Setup & Update

This script will pull and create each of our modules by checking out the specified branches into the specified folders.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

### Start your services

This will start our services using docker-compose and the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

If everything was successful then you should now be able to navigate to [https://appname.dxgroup.local/](https://appname.dxgroup.local/) and see the Mobility login page.

### Trust the Caddy Root CA certificate on your browser

To prevent your browser from giving security warnings you should trust the Root CA certificate that Caddy generates on the initial start-up.
You can download it from your Caddy container by using Docker Desktop / VS Code's Docker Extention or a shell session into the container.

Once inside the container, you can find it at:
`/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt`

This is the CA that is used to sign all the certificates generated by Caddy for use in the reverse proxy.

Download it or copy paste the contents to a file on your local system. You will then have to import that file in the relevant applications:

#### Chrome/Chromium

`Settings > Privacy and security > Security > Manage certificates`

Import it under the `Authorities` tab.

On the popup, ensure you tick `Trust this certificate for identifying websites` before pressing OK.

#### Firefox

`Settings > Privacy & Security > Security > View Certificates`

Import it under the `Authorities` tab.

On the popup, ensure you tick `Trust this CA to identify websites` before pressing OK.

#### Postman

`Settings > Certificates > CA Certificates`

Ensure CA Certificates are enabled and then you can select the file.

#### OS Level Certificate Manager

You can also trust the certificate on an OS level. Various applications do this depending on your OS but they should all follow a similar process. Import and trust the certificate as a Certificate Authority.

#### Notes

-   This certificate is valid for 10 years after generation
-   You will have to redo this if you remove the `caddy_data` named volume as a new CA certificate will then be generated.

### sDev Sync + Gen Code

This script uses the maintenance password and the specified URLs to run operations in sDev. The arguments are a list of operations to perform and operations will be performed on each URL (module) before moving on to the next operation.

The following command will `sync` all modules sequentially and then `gen` all modules only if each `sync` is successful:

```bash
./remote.sh REMOTESYNCONLY REMOTEGENONLY
```

### PHP Debugging

In this repo, you will find an `Xdebug.Dockerfile`, which builds on the base image to add PHP Xdebug configuration.
You can use this modified image by updating the service to build it rather than using the base image:

```yaml
service_name:
    build:
        context: .
        dockerfile: Xdebug.Dockerfile
    image: customxdebug
    # image: johanmarx/stratusolve_php_apache:latest
    volumes:
        - ./src:/var/www/html
    extra_hosts:
        - host.docker.internal:host-gateway
        - ...
    env_file:
        - sdev.env
```

You can then listen for debug connections on VSCode or PhpStorm on port `9003`.

### Redis Insight

Included in the services is an instance of [Redis Insight](https://redis.io/docs/connect/insight/) which can be used to view and test the Redis data store.

This can be accessed locally at [https://redisinsight.mobility.local/](https://redisinsight.mobility.local/).

You can get the connection details from the relevant .env files. Any setup will persist on restart unless the volume (`redisinsight_data`) is removed.

### PHPUnit Tests

Included is a `sdev_run_tests.sh` bash script that will run the [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) tests for the modules where it is defined. You can modify the array in the script if you want to reduce the scope.

This scripts works by executing the PHPUnit script in the running Docker containers so please ensure your services are up and running locally.

```bash
./sdev_run_tests.sh
```

## FAQs

### `fatal: Authentication failed for <repo>` when I run the setup script

Ensure that you are logged in to GitHub CLI. You can run

```bash
git config --list
```

to check that you have GitHub `credential` entries.

### I get a `permission denied` message when trying to execute a script

You might have to give the `execute` permission to the script. Try using this command on the script:

```bash
chmod +x <script name>
```

### After Gen I see files with `Modified (File Mode)` changes in git

-   This might be because your git setup sees permission changes on files as file changes
-   Navigate to your repo folder and do a `git config core.filemode false`

### I get a `permission denied` response when I Sync or Gen

This is most likely due to the user permissions on the source folder. When binding the folder as a volume to the container the internal processes run as a different user which is not present on your host system.
Run the following script to allow read and write access to all users:

```bash
sudo chmod 777 -R <source folder>
```

### I get a `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:<path>. Is the docker daemon running?` message when running Docker commands

This means your Docker daemon isn't running.

If you are using Docker Desktop, ensure that it is running.

If you are running Docker natively you might have to start the Docker daemon manually by running:

```bash
sudo dockerd
```

or checkout [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#configure-docker-to-start-on-boot-with-systemd) to have it start on boot.

### My containers `exited with a status of 0` when I tried to start them

I suggest you try to remove all the containers with the following commands and try again:

```bash
docker compose down --remove-orphans
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q) #remove ALL containers
```

Next to pruge all images from you system you can run:

```bash
docker image prune -a -f
```

This will then cause the next compose up to redownload all images and rebuild all containers.
